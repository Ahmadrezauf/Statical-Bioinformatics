# Description

This repository has been made for a course in statistical bioinformatics. Here, I will put the homeworks and other material related to the class. 

I want to mention the most-used framework in R for bioinformatics that contains a lot of useful material related to widely-used methods in bioinformatics and almost every workflow that is used by bioinformaticians.

For example, there is a popular framework which is used for single-cell RNA-seq analysis in bioconductor: [link](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/BioC2017/Day2/Workshops/singleCell/doc/workshop.html "link")

In this workflow topics such as normalization,  dimension reduction, clustering, and lineage inference is discussed.
